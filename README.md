# Taxi-MapReduce
The data set itself is a set of simple text ﬁles. Each taxi trip report is a different line in a ﬁle.

Wrote a MapReduce program that checks all of the ﬁles and computes the total amount of revenue (total dollars) for each date present in the data set.

Wrote a MapReduce program that computes 5 taxi drivers who had the most revenue in the data set.
